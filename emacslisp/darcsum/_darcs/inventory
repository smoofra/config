 Internally, keep track of whatever other changes darcs spit out for

 those changes during recording.  However, keep toggle from showing
 any other changes.  Once this is done, the ignore-next-hunk stuff can
 be dropped from parsing change sets.  It was causing problems in the
 rmfile case, since darcs was spitting out the hunk that should have
 been ignored before the rmfile.

 Sometimes darcs has read extra input from terminal and it tries to return

 stream. However, this is not allowed by runtime library and darcs dies with
 runtime error. 
 
 I try to avoid this bug by just sending "y" or "n" to darcs process. 
 However, this kludge does not work if the input stream is handled in cooked
 mode (line-by-line, as opposed to raw character-by-character mode).
